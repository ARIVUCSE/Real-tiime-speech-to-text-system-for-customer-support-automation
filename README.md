🗣️ Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services
This project provides a basic speech-to-text transcription system using Python. It allows users to convert audio input into text for transcription purposes, leveraging popular libraries and APIs.

📌 Features
Convert audio recordings into written transcripts.

Supports common audio file formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).

Uses pre-trained speech recognition engines.

Outputs text files or displays results inline.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install speechrecognition pydub
Additional requirements (based on the notebook):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ipython
If you use audio formats like MP3, you may also need to install ffmpeg:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download ffmpeg and add it to your PATH
📂 Usage
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Open the notebook:
project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb

Run all cells.

Upload your audio file in the supported format.

View or save the transcribed text.

📁 Example
python
Copy
Edit
# Example usage inside the notebook
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.AudioFile('sample.wav') as source:
    audio = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
print(text)
✅ Output
Transcription appears in the notebook output cells.

Optionally, you can save the transcript to a .txt file.

📌 Limitations
Accuracy depends on audio quality and background noise.

Performance may vary with accents and speech clarity.
